# Stef Stuntpiloot

Stef Stuntpiloot (Looping Louie) controlled by an Arduino Nano and an L293D motor driver IC. Based on [this project](https://www.instructables.com/HACKED-Looping-Louie-on-steroids/), but with more functionality.

### Functionality
* An LCD menu that can be navigated using push buttons.
* Run at regular speed (~3V).
* Run at speed controlled by a potmeter.
* Change speed randomly, at random intervals. With a certain probability, the voltage is reversed (for 1 second) to make the game more interesting.
* Save settings (EEPROM).
* Display amount of sips (or shots) after a round. This is optional.
